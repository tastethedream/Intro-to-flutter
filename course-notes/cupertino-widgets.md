 # Cupertino Widgets

 - Are widgets for IOS designs

 - They are all stored in a library

 `import 'package:flutter/cupertino.dart';`

 - The Cupertino picker is an IOS alternative to the dropdown menu

 ```
 child: CupertinoPicker(
                  itemExtent: null,
                  onSelectedItemChanged: null,
                  children: null)),
 ```

 - `itemExtent` - the height of each item inside the picker
 - `onSelectedItemChanged` - what will happen when the user changes the selection
 - `children` - What will be displayed inside the picker
